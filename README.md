# RockPaperScissors
Just another beginner project from the odin project.
For now I am just logging to the console and later I will update the code to add a UI and graphical output...I assume since it said we will use this code again later.

Took longer than I wanted just figuring out syntax and coming accross features I thought would make it better.  Added the if statement that if the input is not rock, paper, or scissors then it requests another input but also decreses the round counter so that it stays in the current round.
